# Privault Development Plan
## Zero-Knowledge Password Manager Web App

### Project Overview
Build a privacy-first password manager using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, and client-side encryption.

**Core Principles:**
- Zero-knowledge architecture (server never sees unencrypted data)

### Security Principles
1. **Zero-Knowledge**: Server never sees unencrypted data
2. **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens in browser
3. **Ephemeral Keys**: Master passphrase never persisted
4. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Unique IV for each encryption
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers

### Development Workflow
1. Complete each phase in order
2. Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
3. Security review at end of each critical phase
4. User testing for UI/UX phases
5. Performance testing before deployment
