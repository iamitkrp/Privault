## üéØ Project Overview

**Privault** is a modern, zero-knowledge password manager built as a web application. The core principle is that your passwords and sensitive data are encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers, meaning we (the service provider) can never see your actual passwords - even if we wanted to.

**üéâ PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETED - All 9 development phases successfully implemented!**

### What Makes Privault Special?

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your master password never leaves your device
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens in your browser using military-grade AES-256
- **Modern Web Technologies**: Built with the latest React/Next.js for a smooth user experience
- **Privacy-First Design**: We can't see your data, and no one else can either
- **Production-Ready**: Fully optimized with security monitoring and performance enhancements

### Target Users
- Individuals who want secure password storage
- Privacy-conscious users who don't trust traditional password managers
- Anyone who wants to understand how zero-knowledge encryption works
- Organizations requiring secure credential management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Security Principles

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

```
User's Device (Browser)          |          Server (Supabase)
                                |
1. Master Password              |
2. ‚Üì PBKDF2 Key Derivation     |
3. Encryption Key Generated    |          ‚ùå Never sees master password
4. ‚Üì AES-256 Encryption        |          ‚ùå Never sees encryption key
5. Encrypted Data ‚Üí            |          ‚úÖ Stores encrypted blobs only
                                |          ‚úÖ Can't decrypt user data
```

### Security Layers

1. **Transport Security**: HTTPS encryption for all communications
2. **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users only access their data
3. **Client-Side Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with unique IVs for each encryption
4. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and unique salt per user
5. **Session Management**: 15-minute auto-lock, secure session handling

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Your master password**: Never sent to our servers
- **Your encryption key**: Generated locally, never leaves your device
- **Your passwords**: Encrypted before leaving your browser
- **Our access**: We can only see encrypted blobs, not your actual data
