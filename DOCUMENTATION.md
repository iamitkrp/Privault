## üéØ Project Overview

**Privault** is a modern, zero-knowledge password manager built as a web application. The core principle is that your passwords and sensitive data are encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers, meaning we (the service provider) can never see your actual passwords - even if we wanted to.

### What Makes Privault Special?

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your master password never leaves your device
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens in your browser using military-grade AES-256
- **Modern Web Technologies**: Built with the latest React/Next.js for a smooth user experience
- **Privacy-First Design**: We can't see your data, and no one else can either

### Target Users
- Individuals who want secure password storage
- Privacy-conscious users who don't trust traditional password managers
- Anyone who wants to understand how zero-knowledge encryption works

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Security Principles

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

```
User's Device (Browser)          |          Server (Supabase)
                                |
1. Master Password              |
2. ‚Üì PBKDF2 Key Derivation     |
3. Encryption Key Generated    |          ‚ùå Never sees master password
4. ‚Üì AES-256 Encryption        |          ‚ùå Never sees encryption key
5. Encrypted Data ‚Üí            |          ‚úÖ Stores encrypted blobs only
                                |          ‚úÖ Can't decrypt user data
```

### Security Layers

1. **Transport Security**: HTTPS encryption for all communications
2. **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users only access their data
3. **Client-Side Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with unique IVs for each encryption
4. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and unique salt per user
5. **Session Management**: 15-minute auto-lock, secure session handling

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Your master password**: Never sent to our servers
- **Your encryption key**: Generated locally, never leaves your device
- **Your passwords**: Encrypted before leaving your browser
- **Our access**: We can only see encrypted blobs, not your actual data

## üîê OTP Security System

### Overview
The OTP (One-Time Password) security system adds an additional layer of protection to vault operations by requiring email-based verification for sensitive actions.

### OTP Service Architecture

#### Core Functions (`services/otp.service.ts`)
```javascript
// Generate and send OTP
sendVaultOTP(userId, email, purpose)
// Verify submitted OTP code
verifyOTP(userId, otpCode, purpose)
// Check if user needs OTP after logout
needsOTPForVaultAccess(userId)
// Track user logout for OTP requirements
markUserLogout(userId)
// Clear logout marker after successful verification
clearLogoutMarker(userId)
```

#### OTP Generation
- **Format**: 6-digit numeric codes (000000-999999)
- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Expiration**: 10 minutes from creation
- **Purpose**: Specific to action (vault_access | vault_password_change)

#### Email Integration
Currently implemented with console logging for development:
```javascript
console.log(`
üîê PRIVAULT SECURITY OTP
To: ${email}
Purpose: ${purpose}
Code: ${otpCode}
Expires: ${expiresAt}
`);
```

**Production Integration**: Easily upgradeable to real email services:
- SendGrid
- AWS SES  
- Nodemailer
- Mailgun

- **Email Display**: Shows masked email address for verification
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during OTP sending and verification
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid/expired codes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Security Implementation

#### Logout Tracking
```javascript
// On logout - mark timestamp
localStorage.setItem(`last-logout-${userId}`, Date.now().toString());

// On vault access - check if OTP needed
const needsOTP = (Date.now() - logoutTime) < (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### Database Security
- **Row Level Security**: Users can only access their own OTP records
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired OTPs automatically removed

- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper user association

#### Verification Flow
1. **Generate OTP**: Create 6-digit code with 10-minute expiration
2. **Store Securely**: Save to database with user association and purpose
3. **Send Notification**: Email OTP to user (console log in development)
4. **User Entry**: User enters OTP in verification form
5. **Validate**: Check code, expiration, and purpose match
6. **Mark Used**: Prevent replay attacks by marking OTP as used
7. **Grant Access**: Allow user to proceed with intended action

### Integration Points

#### Vault Page Integration
```javascript
// Check if OTP needed after login
const needsOTP = OTPService.needsOTPForVaultAccess(user.id);

// Show OTP verification before vault access
{needsOTP && !otpVerified ? (
  <VaultOTPVerification 
    purpose="vault_access"
    onVerified={() => setOtpVerified(true)}
  />
) : (
  <VaultUnlock />
)}
```

#### Password Change Integration
```javascript
// Require OTP before password change form
{vaultAction === 'change-password' ? (
  needsOTP && !otpVerified ? (
    <VaultOTPVerification purpose="vault_password_change" />
  ) : (
    <VaultChangePassword />
  )
) : null}
```

4. For each password to encrypt:
   a. Generate unique 12-byte IV
   b. Encrypt: AES-256-GCM(data, key, IV)
   c. Combine: IV + encrypted_data + auth_tag
   d. Encode: Base64(combined_data)
5. Store encoded data in database
```

### Decryption Process
```
1. Retrieve encrypted data from database
2. Decode: Base64 ‚Üí raw bytes
3. Split: IV + encrypted_data + auth_tag
4. Decrypt: AES-256-GCM(encrypted_data, key, IV)
5. Verify: Authentication tag validates data integrity
6. Return: Original plaintext data
```

### Key Security Features
- **Unique IVs**: Every encryption uses a new, random IV
- **Authentication**: GCM mode provides built-in tamper detection
- **Salt Storage**: Unique salt per user prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with high iteration count resists brute force
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data cleared from memory when not needed
