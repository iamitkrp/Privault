# Vault V2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
All 12 verification comments have been successfully implemented, completing the foundational infrastructure for Privault Vault V2.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Component Exports Fixed
**File:** `components/vault-v2/index.ts`

Created stub files for all missing components to prevent build errors:
- Credential components: CredentialList, CredentialGrid, CredentialForm, CredentialDetails
- Expiration components: ExpirationModal, ExpirationWarning
- Search components: SearchBar, FilterPanel, SortControls
- Stats components: VaultStats, HealthScore, ExpirationChart
- Import/Export components: ImportModal, ExportModal, FormatSelector
- Common components: ErrorState, EmptyState, ConfirmDialog
- Layout components: VaultLayout, VaultSidebar

All stubs include proper TypeScript interfaces and placeholder UI.

---

### 2. Repository Layer Created
**File:** `lib/vault-v2/storage/repository.ts`

Implemented `IVaultRepository` with Supabase integration:
- Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Filtering and pagination support
- Optimistic partial updates (only defined fields)
- Soft delete support
- Access count tracking with atomic increment
- Safe type mapping between database and application models

---

### 3. Encryption Service Implemented
**File:** `lib/vault-v2/encryption/encryption.service.ts`

Created encryption service using existing crypto utilities:
- Implements `IEncryptionService` interface
- Wraps `lib/crypto/crypto-utils.ts` functions
- AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
- Compatible with passphrase-manager key derivation

---

### 4. Expiration & History Services Created
**Files:**
- `lib/vault-v2/services/expiration.service.ts`
- `lib/vault-v2/services/history.service.ts`

**ExpirationService:**
- Expiration date calculation
- Status determination (active/expiring_soon/expired)
- Event logging to `expiration_events` table
- Unacknowledged event retrieval
- Event acknowledgment

**HistoryService:**
- Password history tracking on changes
- SHA-256 password hashing for reuse detection
- Encrypted old password storage for recovery
- Reuse checking with exclusion support

---

### 5. Migration Script Created
**File:** `database/migrate-v1-to-v2.sql`

Comprehensive migration from V1 to V2:
- Safe, idempotent migration from `vaults` to `vault_credentials`
- Preserves encrypted data as-is (client re-encryption on first access)
- Migration tracking table for audit trail
- Dry-run mode support
- Verification queries included
- Error handling with graceful fallback
- Updated `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` with execution instructions

---

### 6. Placeholder Pages Created
**Files:**
- `app/vault-v2/import/page.tsx`
- `app/vault-v2/export/page.tsx`
- `app/vault-v2/settings/page.tsx`
- Updated `app/vault-v2/page.tsx`

All pages include:
- Professional placeholder UI
- Feature descriptions
- Links to related functionality
- TODO markers for future integration

Main page updated with:
- Lock/unlock state
- Stats display
- Quick action cards
- Search bar placeholder

---

### 7. Constants Consolidated
**Files Updated:**
- `lib/vault-v2/core/constants.ts` (expanded)
- `constants/index.ts` (deprecated old vault constants)

**Added to V2 constants:**
- Database table names (V2 + legacy mapping)
- Additional feature flags
- Vault-specific routes
- Aligned encryption settings with crypto-utils

**Deprecated in legacy constants:**
- Old table names (with migration notes)
- Old API endpoints (with V2 references)
- Old routes (with V2 alternatives)

---

### 8. VaultService Update Fixed
**File:** `lib/vault-v2/services/vault.service.ts`

Fixed `updateCredential` method:
- Constructs `Partial<VaultCredential>` with only defined fields
- Prevents undefined values from overwriting database data
- Conditional field inclusion based on presence in DTO
- Proper version incrementing

---

### 9. Vault Stats Calculation Fixed
**File:** `lib/vault-v2/services/vault.service.ts`

Improved average strength calculation:
- Tracks `analyzedCount` for successfully decrypted credentials
- Calculates `avgStrength = totalStrength / analyzedCount` (not total count)
- Uses analyzed count for health score calculation
- Prevents skewed results from failed decryptions

---

### 10. Search with Fuse.js Prepared
**Files:**
- `lib/vault-v2/services/search.service.ts` (new)
- `lib/vault-v2/services/vault.service.ts` (documented)
- `package.json` (fuse.js added)

**SearchService created:**
- In-memory index management
- Fuzzy search with configurable threshold
- Fallback substring search
- Index refresh on CRUD operations
- Privacy-preserving (client-side only)

**VaultService updated:**
- Documented Fuse.js integration approach
- TODO markers for production implementation
- Current simple implementation for development

---

### 11. Jest Test Configuration Added
**Files:**
- `jest.config.ts` (new)
- `jest.setup.ts` (new)
- `package.json` (updated)

**Test infrastructure:**
- Jest 29 with ts-jest
- jsdom environment for React components
- Path aliases configured (@/ mapping)
- Coverage thresholds set (70% global)
- Web Crypto API mocked for Node.js
- Test scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`, `test:vault`

**Dependencies added:**
- jest
- ts-jest
- jest-environment-jsdom
- @types/jest

---

### 12. Vault Hooks & Context Created
**Files:**
- `lib/vault-v2/hooks/use-vault-session.ts` (new)
- `lib/vault-v2/hooks/use-credentials.ts` (new)
- `lib/vault-v2/context/vault-context.tsx` (new)
- `lib/vault-v2/hooks/index.ts` (barrel export)

**useVaultSession hook:**
- Manages unlock/lock state
- Integrates with passphrase-manager
- Session expiry handling
- Auto-lock on timeout
- Session extension support

**useCredentials hook:**
- CRUD operations with loading/error states
- Decrypted credential caching
- Stats loading
- Search integration
- Automatic stats refresh

**VaultProvider context:**
- Combines session + credentials management
- Auto-initializes VaultService on unlock
- Dependency injection for all services
- Auth integration via useAuth hook
- Single source of truth for vault state

- Master key never leaves the client
- Session auto-locks on timeout/tab close
- Passwords hashed with SHA-256 for reuse detection
- Row-level security (RLS) enforced in Supabase
- Optimistic locking prevents concurrent update conflicts
