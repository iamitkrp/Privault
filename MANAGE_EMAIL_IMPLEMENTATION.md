# Manage Email Implementation Guide

## Overview

The "Manage Email" functionality has been successfully implemented to replace the simple "Update Email" button. This new feature provides users with:

1. **Email Update**: Change account email address with OTP verification
2. **Profile Deletion**: Permanently delete account and all data with OTP verification

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ Security First
- **OTP Verification Required**: Both email updates and profile deletion require OTP verification sent to the user's current email
- **Email Validation**: Comprehensive email format validation and confirmation
- **Safe Profile Deletion**: Cascading database deletes ensure all user data is properly removed

### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience
- **Modern Modal Interface**: Clean, responsive modal with clear sections for each action
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Clear warnings for destructive actions (profile deletion)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Success/error messages with appropriate styling
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### ðŸ›  Technical Implementation
- **Database Schema Updates**: Extended OTP purposes to support new actions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with updated interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Migration Support**: Database migration script for existing installations

## Files Changed

### Core Components
- **`components/ui/manage-email-modal.tsx`** - New modal component for email management
- **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** - Updated dashboard to use new "Manage Email" button

### Backend Services
- **`services/auth.service.ts`** - Added email update and profile deletion methods
- **`services/otp.service.ts`** - Extended to support new OTP purposes
- **`components/vault/vault-otp-verification.tsx`** - Updated to handle new purposes

### Database Schema
- **`database/schema.sql`** - Updated OTP purposes constraint
- **`schema.sql`** - Updated OTP purposes constraint

- **`types/database.ts`** - Updated TypeScript types

## How to Use

### For Users

1. **Access Manage Email**:
   - Go to Dashboard â†’ Account Overview
   - Click "Manage Email" button (renamed from "Update Email")

2. **Update Email**:
   - Enter new email address
   - Confirm new email address
   - Click "Update Email (Requires OTP)"
   - Enter OTP code sent to current email
   - Email will be updated after verification

3. **Delete Profile**:
   - Scroll to "Delete Account" section in the modal
   - Read the warning carefully
   - Click "Delete Account (Requires OTP)"
   - Enter OTP code sent to current email
   - Account will be permanently deleted

### For Developers

#### Database Migration (if you have existing data)
```sql
-- Run this script to update existing databases
\i database/migrate-otp-purposes.sql
```

#### New OTP Purposes
The system now supports 4 OTP purposes:
- `vault_access` - For accessing vault after login
- `vault_password_change` - For changing vault master password
- `email_update` - For updating email address (NEW)
- `profile_delete` - For deleting user profile (NEW)

#### API Usage
```typescript
// Update user email
const result = await AuthService.updateUserEmail(userId, newEmail);

// Delete user account  
const result = await AuthService.deleteUserAccount(userId);

// Send OTP for new purposes
await OTPService.sendVaultOTP(userId, email, 'email_update');
await OTPService.sendVaultOTP(userId, email, 'profile_delete');
```

## Security Considerations

### Email Updates
- Requires OTP verification to current email address
- Updates both Supabase Auth and profile table
- Email validation ensures proper format
- Prevents setting same email as current

### Profile Deletion
- Requires OTP verification for safety
- Cascading deletes remove all associated data:
  - User profile
  - Vault data
  - Vault items
  - Password history
  - OTP verifications
- Signs out user immediately after deletion
- Redirects to home page

## Error Handling

### Email Update Errors
- Invalid email format
- Email already in use
- Database update failures
- OTP verification failures

### Profile Deletion Errors
- Database deletion failures
- OTP verification failures
- Network connectivity issues

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Design
- **Blue Theme**: Email update section uses calming blue colors
- **Red Theme**: Profile deletion uses warning red colors
- **Clear Icons**: Intuitive icons for each action type
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes

### User Safety
- **Clear Warnings**: Prominent warnings for irreversible actions
- **Confirmation Steps**: Multiple confirmation steps for safety
- **Progress Indicators**: Loading states during processing
- **Success Feedback**: Clear success messages with next steps

## Testing Checklist

### Email Update Flow
- [ ] Modal opens correctly from dashboard
- [ ] Email validation works (format, confirmation)
- [ ] OTP is sent to current email
- [ ] OTP verification works correctly
- [ ] Email is updated in both Auth and profile
- [ ] Success message is displayed
- [ ] Modal closes automatically

### Profile Deletion Flow
- [ ] Warning messages are clear and prominent
- [ ] OTP is sent to current email
- [ ] OTP verification works correctly
- [ ] All user data is deleted from database
- [ ] User is signed out automatically
- [ ] Redirect to home page works

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid OTP codes show appropriate errors
- [ ] Expired OTP codes are handled
- [ ] Concurrent operations are managed safely
- [ ] Email sending failures have fallback (console)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email Verification**: Require verification of new email before switching
2. **Account Recovery**: Grace period for account recovery after deletion
3. **Export Data**: Allow data export before account deletion
4. **Admin Controls**: Admin interface for managing user accounts
5. **Audit Trail**: Track email changes for security monitoring

### Technical Debt
1. **Admin User Deletion**: Currently requires manual admin intervention for full Auth user removal
2. **Email Service**: Could benefit from more robust email service integration
3. **Rate Limiting**: Could add rate limiting for OTP requests
4. **Internationalization**: Could add multi-language support
